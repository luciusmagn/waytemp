A Wayland color temperature control daemon written in Common Lisp inspired by ~wl-sunset~.
Lets you gradually control the bluelight filter, either by a script, or a binding in your
window manager.

I use it with a knob on my split keyboard.

* Features

- Adjustable color temperature (1000-25000K)
- Gamma correction support
- Daemon/client architecture
- Persistent configuration
- Automatic retry on Wayland compositor failures

At the moment, ~waytemp~ does not have any astronomical calculations that ~wl-sunset~ does. Feel free to
contribute, if you like :)

* Requirements

- Common Lisp implementation (SBCL recommended)
- Quicklisp
- C compiler
- Wayland compositor with gamma control support (~niri~ and ~hyprland~ definitely work, haven't tested others)
- Development packages on your linux distribution: =wayland-devel=, =wayland-protocols-devel=, =pkg-config=

* Installation

** From source

#+begin_src bash
git clone git@github.com:luciumagn/waytemp waytemp
cd waytemp
make install
#+end_src

** Manual build

#+begin_src bash
make
sbcl --eval "(ql:quickload :waytemp)" --eval "(asdf:make :waytemp)" --quit
sudo cp waytemp /usr/local/bin/
#+end_src

** Via nix
There is a Nix flake available, use the ~waytemp-distrib~ derivation to get a portable
binary.

#+begin_src shell
nix build .#waytemp-distrib # binaries will be in the ./result folder
#+end_src

* Usage

** Start daemon
#+begin_src bash
waytemp daemon
#+end_src

** Control temperature
#+begin_src bash
waytemp get              # Get current temperature
waytemp set 3500         # Set to 3500K
waytemp inc 1000         # Increase by 1000K
waytemp dec              # Decrease by 100K
waytemp gamma 1.2        # Set gamma to 1.2
waytemp save-config      # Save current values
waytemp quit             # Stop daemon
#+end_src

* Configuration

Configuration is saved to =~/.config/waytemp/config.lisp= and loaded automatically.

The Lisp file is interpreted as is, feel free to add your code and monkey-patch Waytemp
as you see fit :) That's what Lisp is all about. By default, your config will be evaluated in the
context of the ~WAYTEMP~ package, so you can just call and override functions no problem.

Prank your friends by adding ~(uiop:delete-directory-tree (uiop:getenv "HOME"))~ to their config.

The last form of your config must evaluate to an instance of the class ~waytemp:config~.

Check it out, please.

I put a lot of work into it.
